**Subject:** Story Idea: How DappleDoc is automating the "Execution Gap" in PR

Hi {{Journalist}},

I've been following your coverage of {{RecentTopic}} at {{Outlet}}. 

I'm reaching out from DappleDoc. We've built an AI layer that automates the transition from spreadsheets to execution. 

Specifically, we're seeing interns and ops teams use it to {{ValueProp}}. Given your interest in AI workforce changes, I thought you'd want to see how we're eliminating the manual 'spreadsheet-to-email' grind.

Would you be open to a quick look at the prototype?

Best,
[Your Name]

**Subject:** Guest Suggestion: Automating the Future of Business Ops

Hi {{Journalist}},

Big fan of {{Outlet}}. Your recent episode with {{RecentGuest}} really hit on the challenges of scaling operations.

At DappleDoc, we're focused on "The Last Mile of Automation"—the work that usually falls to manual data entry and outlook coordination. We have a compelling story about how AI agents are finally taking over these workflows.

Would love to discuss a potential guest appearance to talk about "The End of the Manual Grind."

Best,
[Your Name]

**Subject:** Quick Question: AI Agent workflows for {{Outlet}}

Hi {{Journalist}},

I'm with DappleDoc. We're launching a tool that connects your Excel plans directly to Outlook execution using AI.

Short version: It does the work of a PR intern automatically. 

Interested in a 5-minute demo?
