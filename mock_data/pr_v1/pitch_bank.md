# Pitch Bank (Fake Data)

## Template: Trend
**Subject:** Fast care is becoming the default, even for skin concerns

**Body:**
Hi {{Journalist}} — I’m reaching out with a story idea that fits your coverage of {{Beat}}.

We’re seeing a shift in healthcare behavior: people increasingly want next-step clarity fast, not a long appointment process. Skin concerns are a perfect example because uncertainty creates anxiety and people often wait weeks for access.

I can share 3 clear trends we’re seeing and why “fast, guided decision support” is becoming a new category. If useful, I can also connect you with our clinical co-founder for a quote.

Interested in a quick chat or I can send bullets tailored to your audience.

## Template: Consumer
**Subject:** Skin anxiety is rising, and people are self-triaging online

**Body:**
Hi {{Journalist}} — quick note with a consumer health angle.

When a new spot or rash shows up, people often spiral: hours of searching, conflicting info, and delayed care. We built a speed-first flow that gives people practical next steps quickly, designed to reduce unnecessary worry and improve access.

If you’re working on anything about consumer health behavior or anxiety, I can share the “what people do first” pattern and a few practical tips dermatologists wish more people followed.

## Template: Founder Story
**Subject:** A design leader built a speed-first care experience

**Body:**
Hi {{Journalist}} — I thought this might fit your interest in founders building in healthcare.

I’m a product design leader who partnered with a practicing dermatologist to build a “fast clarity” experience for skin concerns. The story is about designing for trust: what we show, what we refuse to claim, and how we guide users toward the next right step.

If you’re open, I can share the design choices that made the biggest difference, plus what we learned about how people behave when anxious.

## Template: Local
**Subject:** Chicago area startup focused on faster dermatology access

**Body:**
Hi {{Journalist}} — local story idea for your {{City}} coverage.

We’re a small team building a dermatologist-guided skin support experience designed to reduce wait-time friction. We can share local context on access challenges and how consumers are trying to solve it today. Happy to provide a founder interview and local numbers (non-sensitive, high level).

## Template: Data
**Subject:** What people actually ask about skin concerns (anonymized trends)

**Body:**
Hi {{Journalist}} — I can share a small set of anonymized trends from skin concern submissions that surprised us.

It maps to a bigger story: what people worry about most, where misinformation shows up, and what “next-step clarity” looks like when done responsibly.

If you’re writing about consumer health, digital care, or medical misinformation, I can send a short data brief.

## Template: Podcast
**Subject:** Podcast guest: the future of “fast clarity” care experiences

**Body:**
Hi {{Journalist}} — are you booking guests for {{Show}}?

I can speak to how care experiences are changing, why people want fast clarity, and how to design trust into sensitive flows. I can also bring our dermatologist co-founder for a dual perspective: product plus clinical.
