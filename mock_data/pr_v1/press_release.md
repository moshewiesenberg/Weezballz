# Press Release (Fake Data)

**Headline:** DappleDoc launches dermatologist-guided “fast clarity” skin support experience  
**Subhead:** New platform helps people get next-step guidance quickly, reducing wait-time friction  
**Dateline:** Chicago, IL | March 5, 2026 (fake)  

**Body:**
DappleDoc today announced the launch of its dermatologist-guided skin support platform designed to help people get next-step clarity quickly when a skin concern appears. The experience allows users to share photos and context and receive practical guidance on what to do next, including when to monitor, what to try over the counter, and when to seek in-person care.

People often wait weeks for dermatology appointments or spend hours searching online for answers, which often leads to increased anxiety and misinformation. DappleDoc solves this by streamlining the intake process and providing high-quality, clinical guidance in minutes rather than weeks.

“Most people are not looking for a medical lecture. They want to know what to do next,” said Jon Friedman, co-founder of DappleDoc. “By focusing on speed and design, we can help people navigate their skin health with confidence and less stress.”

“Speed matters because uncertainty drives poor decisions,” said Dr. Benji Marks, dermatologist and co-founder. “DappleDoc provides a responsible bridge between noticing a concern and getting the right level of care.”

**About DappleDoc:**
DappleDoc is a dermatologist-guided skin support platform built for speed and clarity. Focused on improving access and reducing uncertainty, DappleDoc helps users understand their skin concerns and decide on the next right step.
