# Online Presence PR Checklist (Fake Data)

- [ ] Website has a clear “what it is” statement above the fold
- [ ] Founder bio is scannable and specific (who, what, why now)
- [ ] Press page includes: boilerplate, logos, founder headshots, product screenshots
- [ ] LinkedIn headline matches one-liner
- [ ] Pinned post matches the primary narrative theme
- [ ] 3 credibility signals visible within 15 seconds (clinical partner, outcomes, privacy stance)

## Notes for Agents:
*   This checklist is used to audit the brand's digital footprint before launching a campaign.
*   "Credibility signals" should be extracted and used as proof points in pitches.
