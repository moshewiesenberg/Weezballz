# PR Strategy and Campaign Plan (Fake Data)

## Campaign goal (primary)
Earn 8 to 12 pieces of coverage in 8 weeks that credibly explain the “fast clarity” value proposition and drive qualified traffic.

## Secondary goals
* 6 podcast interviews to build founder credibility
* 2 contributed articles to establish thought leadership on access and trust

## Narrative themes
1. **Waiting weeks for care creates avoidable anxiety**: The gap between "noticing" and "knowing" is a major stressor.
2. **People do not need more information, they need next-step clarity**: In an age of WebMD-spirals, guided answers are the cure.
3. **The future of care is “fast, guided, and human-supervised”**: Combining design with clinical trust.

## Angle menu (used to match journalists)
* **Trend**: “The rise of fast care and decision support in healthcare”
* **Consumer**: “Why skin anxiety is quietly growing, and what people do about it”
* **Founder story**: “A design leader builds a speed-first care experience”
* **Local**: “Chicago startup tackling dermatology access”
* **Data**: “What people actually ask about skin, based on anonymized trends” (fake dataset)

## Target outlet tiers
* **Tier 1**: Top national tech and business (e.g., TechCrunch, WSJ, Fast Company)
* **Tier 2**: Healthcare, consumer health, startup press (e.g., MedCity News, Well+Good)
* **Tier 3**: Local and niche (e.g., Chicago Inno, dermatological journals)

## KPI definitions
* **Positive reply rate**: 8%+
* **Meeting or interview conversion**: 2%+
* **Coverage**: 1 to 2 per week after week 2

## Workflow
* **Week 1**: Finalize message, angle menu, build media list
* **Week 2**: Send 25 highly targeted pitches
* **Week 3**: Follow ups, expand list, secure interviews
* **Week 4 to 8**: Iterate angles, run a second pitch wave, publish contributed piece
