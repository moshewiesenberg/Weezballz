# DappleDoc Messaging Guidance

## What is DappleDoc?
DappleDoc is the "Operations Intelligence Layer" for modern businesses. We build AI agents that sit between your documents, spreadsheets, and communication tools.

## Core Value Propositions
1. **End Manual To-Log**: Automate the 80% of repetitive data entry and status tracking.
2. **Context-Aware Agents**: Our agents don't just 'write text'; they understand your business processes.
3. **M365 Native**: Built to live where you work—Word, Excel, Outlook.

## Talking Points for Journalists
- "The future of work isn't humans vs. AI; it's humans delegating to AI agents."
- "DappleDoc turns static documentation into active workflows."
- "We are solving the 'translation gap' between planning (Excel) and execution (Outlook)."

## Tone & Voice
- Professional but visionary.
- Practical and results-oriented.
- Avoid hyperbole; focus on "time saved" and "accuracy improved".
